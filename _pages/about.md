Welcome to my homepage! I am pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the College of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University (ZJU), Hangzhou, China, supervised by Prof. Shibo He and Jiming Chen. Previously, I received the B.Eng. degree in automation from Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST), Nanjing, China, in 2019. My research interests include spatial-temporal data mining, anomaly detection and trustworthy AI.
